# GPU Accelerated Quantum Scattering Theory

This project aims at increasing the efficienty of iterative solution computations in [Quantum Scattering Theory](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/1990/ft/ft9908601641) utilizing modern GPU hardware.

## TODO

- Set up nvidia docker image environment to manage dependencies
- Investigate GMRES iterative solvers
- Expirament with cuSparse objects and write functionality for tests using random sparse matrices
- Try GMRES linear iterative solvers on random sparse matrices read from stdin
